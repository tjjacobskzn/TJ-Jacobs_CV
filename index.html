                                My passion in life is nature, nature and nature. I am
                                motivated by change, progress and accomplishments. If given
                                the choice I would be wiring ECU managements and Fly fishing
                                on flats for fish that don't exist.

                            <h4>Marine</h4>
                            <p>
                                I successfully obtained my Category B skippers, enabling me to
                                pilot/captain a motorized vessel under 31ft through the surf
                                zone and up to 40 nautical miles off shore. Within the course
                                I completed First-aid training. This includes training in
                                Stroke scenarios, Fatal bleeding wounds, emergency
                                transmission, safety briefings and general precautions.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Boating</h4>
                            <p>
                                I have been a deckhand on large vessels and work in a
                                family-owned vessel storage company. With this I gained
                                experience in fiberglass work, outboard engines and general
                                rigging and maintenance on boats.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Fishing</h4>
                            <p>
                                I grew up in the northern coast of South Africa. This means
                                that fishing was a natural hobby in my family. In having the
                                privilege of owning a vessel, I have been fortunate enough to
                                have some of the worlds best anglers teaching me from a young
                                age. I have vast experience in game fishing and I have
                                attended many international, national, provincial and
                                inter-club events. I have achieved national and provincial
                                colors in game fishing and home colors for inter-club fishing
                                events.
                            </p>

                            <h4>People skills</h4>
                            <p>
                                I work with walk-in and mobile clients on a daily basis. I am
                                fully able to work with clients in a professional manner. I
                                can easily merge with team members and become a part of the
                                working gears that run a business from the inside.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Planning and events</h4>
                            <p>
                                Within my fishing and automotive background I have had the
                                pleasure of planning, hosting and supporting numerous events.
                                Most of these events are fishing related, this includes :
                                bonanza fishing events, inter-club fishing, national fishing
                                competitions and international comps too. Events like these
                                take enormous amounts of focus, management, financial security
                                and experienced executives.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Logistics</h4>
                            <p>
                                Working with different teams and maintaining clear
                                communication during operations is like second nature to me.
                                Transporting, picking-up and delivering items or vehicles have
                                been a part of my daily routine in the automotive industry.

                                I was raised in an automotive workshop. I can service
                                vehicles, do maintenance on pretty much anything, fabricate
                                parts for vehicles, weld different projects (Tig, MIG, ARC)
                                and work a lathe. I plan on writing my trade test on Petrol
                                and Diesel vehicles. I can wire engine managements (the
                                vehicle's ECU) and fit Software Chips.

                            <p>
                                My go-to hobby is fly fishing. Nothing makes me happier than
                                being on a flat with small waves crashing peacefully and
                                having my rod in hand. Another hobby I have is building things
                                with my hands. I take interest in wood working and I build my
                                own split cane rods. I like to weld parts and
                                machine/fabricate precision parts on a lathe. I enjoy guiding,
                                deckhand and skipper work.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Strong Points</h2>
                            <h3>Honesty</h3>
                            <p>
                                I trust the people I decide to surround myself with and stay
                                true to them to the best of my capabilities
                            </p>

                            <h3>Work ethic</h3>
                            <p>
                                Without a doubt in my heart I will be one of the hardest
                                workers you will ever meet. I execute my work responsibilities
                                to the best of my capabilities and go the extra mile to
                                satisfy expectations
