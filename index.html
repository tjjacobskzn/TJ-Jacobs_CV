                            <p>
                                I grew up in the northern coast of South Africa. In having the
                                privilege of owning a vessel, I have been fortunate enough to
                                have some of the country's best anglers teaching me from a young
                                age. I have vast experience in game fishing and I have
                                attended many national, provincial and
                                inter-club events and achieved colours in them all.

                                <br>
                                I obtained my Category B skippers ticket, enabling me to
                                pilot/captain a motorized vessel through the surf
                                zone and up to 40 nautical miles off shore. Within the course
                                I completed first-aid training. This includes training in
                                stroke scenarios, fatal bleeding wounds, emergency
                                transmission, safety briefings and general precautions.

                                I have been a deckhand on large vessels and work in a
                                family-owned vessel storage company. With this I gained
                                experience in fiberglass work, outboard engines and general
                                rigging and maintenance on boats.

                                I work with walk-in and mobile clients on a daily basis. I am
                                fully able to work with clients in a professional manner. I
                                can easily merge with team members and become a part of the
                                working gears that run a business from the inside.

                                Within my fishing and automotive background I have had the
                                pleasure of planning, hosting and supporting numerous events.
                                Most of these events are fishing related, this includes :
                                bonanza fishing events, inter-club fishing, national fishing
                                competitions and international comps too. Events like these
                                take enormous amounts of focus, management, financial security
                                and experienced executives.

                                communication during operations is like second nature to me.
                                Transporting, picking-up and delivering items or vehicles have
                                been a part of my daily routine in the automotive industry.

                                I was raised in an automotive workshop. I can service
                                vehicles, do maintenance on pretty much anything, fabricate
                                parts for vehicles, weld different projects (Tig, MIG, ARC)
                                and work a lathe. I plan on writing my trade test on Petrol
                                and Diesel vehicles. I can wire engine managements (the
                                vehicle's ECU) and fit Software Chips.

                                My go-to hobby is fly fishing. Nothing makes me happier than
                                being on a flat with small waves crashing peacefully and
                                having my rod in hand. Another hobby I have is building things
                                with my hands. I take interest in wood working and I build my
                                own split cane rods. I like to weld parts and
                                machine/fabricate precision parts on a lathe. I enjoy guiding,
                                deckhand and skipper work.
